 =======================
This is an argument counter and argument vector
This will be called into argument of the main function
So far we have only used int main() and int main(void) 
But now we will be using more of int main(int argc, char *argv) 
This will be the new main fucntion in our project until it 
gets changed.
The argc is the number of arguments being passed into your program 
from the command line and argv is the array of arguments.
argc will be the number of strings pointed to by argv
