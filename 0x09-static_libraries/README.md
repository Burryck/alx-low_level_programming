	 =================================
  All along we have been building a library but it wasn't clear
  After getting to know of static libraries, it has now been
  clearer. This project seeks to build a statics library from the 
  previous projects. It is putting all the functions declared to
  a common library that will be called to include during a program 
  build. README by Amuzu Derrick (Burryck)
