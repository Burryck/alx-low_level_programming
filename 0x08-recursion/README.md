I   PROJECT NUMBER >> 0x08-recursion I
======================================
For the weeks of learning and practising i have
now realised how easy it is to create a new dir
outside the alx dirs for practicals before pushing and testing codes
I will be doing more often of the practices, so must you also
For your personal use, download and install either vscode or codeblocks
Setup the environments and work at your own pace esp, on weekends
when there are no projects.
Copying and pasting others code will only get you confused.
Download youtube videos with IDM on programming on c language
It will help you a lot.
Recommendations will be Bro Code, Caleb Curry giraffe academy and any
other that will keep you active and updated.
Thank you for taking your time to read through my README file.
